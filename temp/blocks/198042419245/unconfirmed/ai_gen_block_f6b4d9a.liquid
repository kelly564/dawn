    , FAQ
    1. Tips for First-Time Users
    Most users won't need to take any special precautions during their first use. However, if you've never used red light therapy before and feel apprehensive, start by wearing a thin T-shirt as a barrier. This provides a psychological transition period. Once your body gradually adjusts to the temperature, you can remove the clothing for direct skin contact. If your skin is naturally sensitive and prone to redness or swelling, we recommend using the massage head gloves over the massage head. This prevents irritation to already sensitive skin while ensuring effective results.
    
    2. How long does it take to feel relief? How long per use？
    Results vary from person to person. The vast majority of users experience significant relief within about a week. Some see remarkable results on the very first day, while others with severe muscle strain may require a longer period. However, with increased massage sessions, everyone ultimately achieves excellent outcomes. Under normal circumstances, we recommend using it for 10-15 minutes per session to achieve relief. If used for over two hours at a time, it may cause slight skin redness. This is due to accelerated blood circulation and is a normal phenomenon of heat therapy. Please do not be concerned.
    
    3. How many modes? Is the intensity appropriate?
    Two temperature settings are available. Three intensity modes are provided: Light, Normal, and Heavy. However, our proprietary chip automatically fine-tunes the pressure within each mode based on factors like your actual muscle thickness, intelligently adapting to deliver optimal pressure distribution.
    
    , 4. Is red light therapy safe? Is it safe for sensitive skin?
    It's completely safe. This is a standard therapeutic technique used by professional physical therapists, which we've simply integrated into our massager. The results are just as effective as clinical treatments. Our massage heads are made from skin-friendly, food-grade silicone, gentle on sensitive skin.
    
    5. Is it rechargeable? How's the battery life?
    The massager is rechargeable and takes approximately 3 hours to fully charge. With daily use of 10 minutes, it can last for 12 days.
    
    6. Is it noisy? Is it easy to operate?
    Featuring a pure copper brushless friction design, it showcases industry-leading circuit integration capabilities and space utilization, ensuring our mechanical structure operates at low volume and minimal noise. This guarantees a comfortable user experience without disturbing others.
    
    7. Which body parts can it be used on?
    Primarily designed for the shoulders and neck, but we considered compatibility with other body parts from the outset. This drove us to develop adaptive pressure chips, enabling users to apply them to the back, waist, legs, arms, and buttocks., 8. Is it suitable for everyone? Can it be used while lying down or on the couch?
    Yes, it is suitable for all individuals, including the elderly and children, though children require parental supervision. However, for those with skin conditions, prior muscle or bone surgeries, or other non-standard circumstances, use should be under medical supervision. It can be used while lying down, on a sofa, or on an airplane, but ensure the massager rests on a soft surface to prevent bearing wear and maintain effectiveness.
    
    9. How should it be cleaned when multiple people share it at home?
    Simply wipe the surface of the massager gently with a clean, damp cloth. We use antibacterial and stain-resistant materials, so users only need to ensure routine daily cleaning.
    
    10. What is return and exchange policy?
    We offer a 7-day no-questions-asked return and refund policy from the date you receive your package, but please ensure returned products are in perfect condition. Under normal usage, if issues arise due to manufacturing defects rather than human error, you may choose between a refund or replacement. We provide a two-year warranty from the date you receive your package. So don't hesitate—give it a try and don't miss out on a great product.
    
    11. Do you ship worldwide? Is there a faster shipping option?
    We ship to most countries worldwide.
    
    Standard shipping：2-3weeks for free
    
    Faster shipping:8-15 days costs £ 9.90.
    
    In the event of extreme weather or war-related disruptions in your area, delivery may be delayed by a few days. However, we guarantee successful delivery will be made eventually. Rest assured.
    
    12. What's included in the package?
    Massager
    adjustable strap
    massage head gloves
    charging cable
    illustrated manual
